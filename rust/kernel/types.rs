/// Runs a cleanup function/closure when dropped.

/// # Examples
///
/// In the example below, we have multiple exit paths and we want to log regardless of which one is
/// taken:
/// ```
/// # use kernel::ScopeGuard;
/// fn example1(arg: bool) {
///     let _log = ScopeGuard::new(|| pr_info!("example1 completed\n"));
///
///     if arg {
///         return;
///     }
///
///     pr_info!("Do something...\n");
/// }
///
/// # example1(false);
/// # example1(true);
/// ```
///
/// In the example below, we want to log the same message on all early exits but a different one on
/// the main exit path:
/// ```
/// # use kernel::ScopeGuard;
/// fn example2(arg: bool) {
///     let log = ScopeGuard::new(|| pr_info!("example2 returned early\n"));
///
///     if arg {
///         return;
///     }
///
///     // (Other early returns...)
///
///     log.dismiss();
///     pr_info!("example2 no early return\n");
/// }
///
/// # example2(false);
/// # example2(true);
/// ```
///
/// In the example below, we need a mutable object (the vector) to be accessible within the log
/// function, so we wrap it in the [`ScopeGuard`]:
/// ```
/// # use kernel::ScopeGuard;
/// fn example3(arg: bool) -> Result {
///     let mut vec =
///         ScopeGuard::new_with_data(Vec::new(), |v| pr_info!("vec had {} elements\n", v.len()));
///
///     vec.try_push(10u8)?;
